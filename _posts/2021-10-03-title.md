title: "My Investment Thesis for Cryptocurriences"

My investment thesis is pretty straight forward; Invest in cryptocurrencies that generate the highest fees. Using https://cryptofees.info/ we can see that Ethereum is generating the most fees so that's where I will allocate the majority of my capital. My thinking is that whatever is generating large fees will enable profitable investment.
