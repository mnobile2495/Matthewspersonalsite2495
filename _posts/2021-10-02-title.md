My thesis for investing on stocks is quite simple I start by doing the following

* Review Debt / Asset Ratio
  * Company **MUST** have more assets than debt
* Review company history
  * Company must have history that inspires investor confidenence as well as competency among management
* Review historical price data
  * Price must not be setting a new 52 week high
  * Price must not be subject to extreme swings
* Identify a story that leads to growth
  * Company must be engaged in some activity/research that will have a strong positive effect on the stock.

Using these simple methods I have managed to average a 20% return since 2018.
