My thesis for investing on stocks is quite simple I start by doing the following

1. Review Debt / Asset Ratio
  1. Company **MUST** have more assets than debt
2. Review company history
  2. Company must have history that inspires investor confidenence as well as competency among management
3. Review historical price data
  3. Price must not be setting a new 52 week high
  3. Price must not be subject to extreme swings
4. Identify a story that leads to growth
 4. Company must be engaged in some activity/research that will have a strong positive effect on the stock.

Using these simple methods I have managed to average a 20% return since 2018.
